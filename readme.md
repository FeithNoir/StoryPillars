# Story Pillars 🏛️✨

A minimalist web application designed to help writers, screenwriters, and storytellers structure their narratives using the proven technique of narrative pillars. This tool provides a clear, organized framework to build compelling plots from a simple idea to a full-fledged story, ensuring all key structural elements are in place.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

*   **HTML5**: For the core semantic structure of the application.
*   **CSS3**: For custom properties (variables) to handle the light and dark theming.
*   **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid and responsive UI development.
*   **JavaScript (ES6+)**: For all application logic, including state management, DOM manipulation, and data handling.

## 🌟 Features

*   ✅ **Narrative Pillar Framework**: Structures your story around key milestones: Setup, Inciting Incident, Rising Action, Midpoint, Climax, and Resolution.
*   ✅ **Dual Modes**: Seamlessly switch between **Write Mode** (using textareas to input your ideas) and **View Mode** (displaying your story in a clean, read-only format).
*   ✅ **Full Data Portability**: Save your entire story structure as a `.json` file to your local machine, and load it back into the app anytime.
*   ✅ **Minimalist UI & Theming**: A clean, distraction-free interface with a beautiful dark mode enabled by default, and an easy toggle to switch to a light theme.
*   ✅ **Responsive Design**: A fluid layout that works perfectly on desktops, tablets, and smartphones for writing on the go.

## 🔮 Future Plans

This prototype is a solid starting point. Future development ideas include:

*   **Customizable Pillar Templates**: Allowing users to create, save, and use different narrative structures (e.g., The Hero's Journey, Save the Cat, Fichtean Curve).
*   **Character & World-Building Tabs**: Expanding the tool to include dedicated sections for character profiles, location details, and lore.
*   **Visual Timeline View**: A graphical representation of the story pillars to visualize the narrative flow.
*   **Markdown Support**: Enabling simple text formatting within the input fields for emphasis and organization.
*   **Export to Multiple Formats**: Adding options to export the final story structure to PDF or plain text files.
*   **Cloud Sync / User Accounts**: Allowing users to save their work online and access it from any device.
